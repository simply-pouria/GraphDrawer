### Graph Drawer

Whenever you search the internet for graph drawers, you will immadiately find diagram drawers related to integrated math, and not something actually related to the Graph Theory.
there are many great apps that can draw diagrams such as Geogebra, desmos etc but non of them can draw an actual Graph!
well, this project is here to fix that, it draws a graph using it's degree sequence, as simple as that!
